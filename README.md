# **Advanced Multi-Agent Pathfinding Techniques for NPC Exploration**

## Introduction

In this project, we researched advanced multi-agent pathfinding techniques to enhance the efficiency and realism of NPC (non-player character) exploration in video game environments. Our primary focus was on solving challenges associated with navigating complex, obstacle-rich terrains, particularly in procedurally generated maps.

## Approach

We explored and implemented several strategies to simulate intelligent NPC behavior:

- **Group Pathfinding**: Ensured efficient and collaborative movement of multiple agents, avoiding bottlenecks and redundant paths.

- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Enabled NPCs to navigate dynamically and smoothly while reacting to environmental obstacles.

- **Flow Field Navigation**: Streamlined group navigation, allowing agents to move in formations and adapt to changes in real time.

- **Formation Management**: Simulated realistic group behavior, maintaining cohesive and tactical formations.

## Techniques Implemented

1. **Heat Maps**

   - Highlighted areas of interest to prioritize NPC exploration.
        
   - Guided agents toward unexplored or high-value zones.

2. **Potential Fields**

   - Allowed dynamic interaction between agents and the environment.

   - Enabled smooth navigation and obstacle avoidance.

3. **Flow Field Navigation**

   - Facilitated efficient group pathfinding.

   - Ensured collaborative and non-redundant movement of agents.

By integrating these methods, our system optimizes NPC exploration, ensuring comprehensive coverage and adaptability to dynamic game conditions, such as fog of war or procedurally generated environments.

## Results

The integration of these advanced techniques resulted in NPC behaviors that are more realistic, efficient, and responsive to environmental changes. These methods also provide scalability for larger groups of agents in complex terrains.

## Conclusion

This project lays the groundwork for advanced AI techniques in video game development, offering solutions for enhancing group-based NPC interactions. By addressing key challenges such as obstacle avoidance, exploration in limited visibility, and tactical group behavior, our research has the potential to:

- Improve the realism and engagement of NPC behavior.

- Enhance player experiences in game genres such as real-time strategy, stealth, and open-world exploration.

- Offer valuable insights and tools for game developers looking to elevate NPC and AI realism in their projects.
